### The Project
A "zine" is a self-published magazine that is typically produced at home and exists in only a very small number. For this project, you will design the content of a zine that is only four pages long. When finished, your zine will be incorporated into the "CDV Zine Collection Edition", a printed collection including each of this semester's students' works.
The content of your zine is a static visualization of the data you have collected over previous week(s), as well as a visual and textual key explaining your methods. The zine comprises of a "cover" (page 1), a "middle spread" (page 2 and 3), and a "back" (page 4). It is created in the form of a website using the tools learned in class.
"Dear Data" by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec serves as inspiration for this project.

#### The Data
Collect data for at least one week. Beforehand clearly define a phenomenon that you plan to observe and the features you will make note of. For example, the phenomenon might be "seeing my reflection", and the features you take note of every time you see your own reflection could be your location, the reflective object, the exact time, whether it was inside or outside, and so on.
Your dataset should have at least 20 data points, each with at least four features, and must be in JSON format. The phenomenon you pick must be something that occurs over time.
It is highly recommended to consider a phenomenon that has nothing to do with technology and that you find poetic.

### The Visualization
The goal of this visualization is display all data the data points and their features at once. The focus is on the artistic, visual design, and not on the communication of information. The visualization will be created using D3js and specifically data groups (<g>), various shapes and attributes that are modified by data functions.   

### Useful Advice
The format of your zine is small. Keep this is mind when deciding on the size of texts you include. The visualization will be ultimately printed. Take into consideration how well contrasts appear on paper when you choose colors. Make test prints!

### Deliverables:
- [X] JSON data set (in-progress), by 2020/03/04
- [ ] paper prototype, by 2020/03/11
- [ ] code for the visualization, by 2020/03/21 (SATURDAY!)
