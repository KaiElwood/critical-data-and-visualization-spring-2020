### Web Scraping

Before we meet on Friday, I would like you to get as far as you can in the following tutorials:

[This](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism) is an excellent class by Sam Lavigne about creative uses of web scraping.

In this Github repository, you can find the actual class notes in the [class note folder](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/tree/master/class-notes).

The following notes are highly worth going through:

- [class 1](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/blob/master/class-notes/class-1.md): it's about the Terminal
- [class 2](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/blob/master/class-notes/class-2.md): introduces Python
- [class 3](https://github.com/antiboredom/sfpc-scrapism/blob/master/class-notes/class-3.md): fundamentals of web scraping


Read through it and try to understand as much as possible. Take notes with questions you have. Don't spend 2 days on it, but do take time for it, it is very useful knowledge in any case :)
